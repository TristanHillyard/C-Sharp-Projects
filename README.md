#Car Insurance

This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's input on policy information
and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that 
have been issued. 

#Students
This is a data visualization application that is meant to store and display new enrolled students. It is an console
application that uses Entity Framework for data access and a code first workflow.
